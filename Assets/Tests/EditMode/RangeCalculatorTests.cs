/*
 * These edit mode tests demonstrate how the pure methods in RangeCalculator
 * can be validated without entering play mode. To run them open the
 * "Test Runner" window in the Unity editor (Window > General > Test Runner),
 * select the **EditMode** tab and click **Run All**.  Each test creates a very
 * small board entirely in memory so nothing in the main scenes is required.
 *
 *  Board layout used in the tests (3x3):
 *      (0,2) (1,2) (2,2)
 *       (0,1) (1,1) (2,1)
 *    (0,0) (1,0) (2,0)
 *  The centre tile at (1,1) is surrounded by six neighbours.  Making the
 *  calculation functions pure means AI coding agents (or humans!) can easily
 *  generate tests like these to confirm behaviour after refactoring.
